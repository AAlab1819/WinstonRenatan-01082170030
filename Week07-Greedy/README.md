# 946A: Partition
The problem here is trying to get the maximum number from list of element. The list will be divided to two groups which is B and C. What we expect to get the maximum is from B-C. The elements of B will be sum up and C too, then we will do B minus C. <br>
The first input is number of total elements. <br>
The second line of input is the value of elements. <br>
The output will be B-C. <br>
The solution here is quite simple, we do a for loop for the elements. If, the value of elements is negative we put it too C. Otherwise, we put the positive one to B. Then it must be the maximum number output. Because, when - meets - it becomes positive. <br>

# 978B: File Name
The problem here is to find how many "xxx" we should remove from the given string, because it is a forbidden characters. <br>
The first line input is the length of string. <br>
The second line input is the string. <br>
The solution here is to loop all the characters one by one, and if there is 'x' character three in a row. We then add the number of removed forbidden characters. <br>
