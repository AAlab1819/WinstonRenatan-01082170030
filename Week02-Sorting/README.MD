# 768A: Oath of the Night's Watch
The problem here is to find how many steward that Jon Snow feed. Jon Snow will feed a steward if there is exactly someone WEAKER AND STRONGER than the steward strength itself. <br>
The first line input will be the number of the stewards, then the second line will be the strength of each steward. <br>
The solution here is to find the smallest and biggest strength in the group. Then we check all the steward's strength, if it is not the smallest nor the biggest strength, then the steward strength must be in between. Then, Jon Snow can feed the person. <br>
Don't forget to output the number of steward that Jon Snow feed. <br>
