# Roy and Trending Topics
The problem here is to find 5 Trending Topics (topics with the highest z-score). Each topic will have its own ID and each of them also have a starting z-score (current). Here are some rules that can increase the z-score of a topic.<br>

1. The topic is mentioned in a 'Post' +50 <br>
2. A like on the topic +5 <br>
3. A comment on the topic +10 <br>
4. A share on the topic +20 <br>

The input here will be number of changes. Each line then consist of Topic ID, current z-score, posts, likes, comments, shares. Where each are seperated by a space. <br>
The output will be the 5 highest z-score topics. Which, each line contain the Topic ID and the new z-score. Which is sorted based on the changes (New z-score - Old z-score). Then if the change z-score is the same, the bigger Topic ID will be prioritize. <br>

# Heaps: Find the Running Median
The problem is to find the median in a list. If the list number is even for example there are four number {1,2,3,4} then the median will be (2+3)/2=2.5. On the other side, if it is odd like three {1,2,3} then the median will be 2.
