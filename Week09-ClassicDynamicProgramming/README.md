The problem here is quite simple, everyone has their own maximum power to carry certain weight. Each item has its own value (price) and their weight. Our job is to find the maximum value one can get, a person can get more than one item depends on their maximum power. <br>
The first input is the total test case. <br>
Where each test case will contain the number of item a store have followed by their value and weight. <br>
Then it will be continued by how many person are there in the grouop, each with their strength/maximum carrying weight. <br>
The output will be the maximum value the group can take. <br>
