# 492B: Vanya and Lanterns
The problem here is to find the minimum radius of a lantern so that it can cover all the streets.<br>
The first line input is the number of lanterns and the length of the street.<br>
The next line will be the location of the lanterns in the streets.<br>
The solution here is first to count the distance from 0 to first lantern, then the edge of the street to the last lantern, and the biggest gap between lanterns by sorting the location of the lantern in non-decreasing way. We then divide the biggest gap by two to find the radius, because it is in between two lanterns.<br>
Then we find the greatest number between those three and print it.<br>
Complexity:<br>
Worst Case: *O*(*nlog(n)*)<br>
Average Case: HOHO(n<sup>2</sup>)<br> 
Best Case: <br>
